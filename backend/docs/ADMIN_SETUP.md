# Administrator Setup Guide

## üîê Security Notice

**Administrator accounts cannot be created through public registration for security reasons.**

This document explains how to properly create and manage administrator accounts in VisionGrade.

## Initial Setup

### Creating the First Administrator

For initial system setup, use the provided script to create the first administrator account:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run the first admin creation script
node scripts/create-first-admin.js
```

The script will prompt you for:
- Administrator email
- Phone number (optional)
- Full name
- Department (optional)
- Secure password

**Password Requirements:**
- At least 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase letter
- Must contain lowercase letter
- Must contain number
- Must contain special character (@$!%*?&)

### Security Features

1. **Role Validation**: Public signup endpoints reject admin role creation
2. **Backend Validation**: Server-side validation prevents admin role bypass
3. **Audit Logging**: All admin creation attempts are logged
4. **Rate Limiting**: Admin creation is rate-limited
5. **Authentication Required**: Only existing admins can create new admins

## Creating Additional Administrators

Once you have the first administrator account, additional admin accounts can be created through:

### Method 1: Admin Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí User Management
3. Click "Create Administrator"
4. Fill in the required information
5. The new admin will receive a welcome email

### Method 2: API Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/create-admin`

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <admin_access_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "facultyName": "John Doe",
  "department": "Computer Science"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Administrator account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "unique_id": "ADM001",
      "email": "admin@example.com",
      "phone": "1234567890",
      "role": "admin",
      "created_at": "2024-10-03T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Admin Account Management

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only create admin accounts when necessary
- **Regular Audits**: Review admin accounts periodically
- **Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA for admin accounts (when available)

### 2. Access Control

- **Role Separation**: Don't use admin accounts for daily tasks
- **Session Management**: Admin sessions should have shorter timeouts
- **IP Restrictions**: Consider restricting admin access to specific IP ranges

### 3. Monitoring

- **Audit Logs**: Monitor all admin activities
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Track and alert on failed admin logins
- **Privilege Escalation**: Monitor for unauthorized privilege changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Administrator account already exists" Error**
   - This occurs when trying to run the first-admin script after an admin already exists
   - Use the admin dashboard or API to create additional admins

2. **"Insufficient Permissions" Error**
   - Only existing administrators can create new admin accounts
   - Verify you're logged in with an admin account

3. **Password Validation Errors**
   - Ensure password meets all requirements
   - Check for special characters and mixed case

### Recovery Scenarios

1. **Lost Admin Access**
   - If all admin access is lost, you may need to:
   - Reset the database and run the first-admin script again
   - Or manually update the database to grant admin role to an existing user

2. **Forgotten Admin Credentials**
   - Use the password reset functionality
   - Admin password resets are logged for security

## API Error Codes

| Code | Description | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `FORBIDDEN_ROLE` | Admin role in public signup | Use proper admin creation method |
| `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` | Non-admin trying to create admin | Log in with admin account |
| `USER_EXISTS` | Email/phone already registered | Use different email/phone |
| `INVALID_ROLE` | Invalid role specified | Use valid role values |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Input validation failed | Check input format and requirements |

## Audit Trail

All administrator-related activities are logged with:
- Timestamp
- User ID performing the action
- IP address
- Action type (ADMIN_CREATE, etc.)
- Success/failure status
- Additional context

These logs are essential for security monitoring and compliance.
