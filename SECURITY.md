## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of VisionGrade seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@visiongrade.com` (if available)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to the maintainers directly

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version, OS, browser, or other relevant environment details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippets, screenshots, or videos (if applicable)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 90 days for critical issues

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

#### For Developers

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files or hardcode secrets
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and run security audits
- **Authentication**: Use strong JWT secrets and proper session management
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and validate data
- **Database**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

#### For Administrators

- **Default Credentials**: Change all default passwords immediately
- **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Backups**: Maintain secure, encrypted backups
- **Updates**: Keep the system and dependencies updated

#### For Users

- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report any unusual account activity
- **Logout**: Always logout from shared or public computers

## Security Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Password hashing using bcrypt with configurable rounds
- Session management with Redis (optional)
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### 🛡️ Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through ORM (Sequelize)
- XSS protection with proper output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- File upload restrictions and validation

### 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

- Comprehensive audit logging
