- Integration testing approach
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Performance testing criteria
- Test automation strategy
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
```markdown
Create: .github/workflows/
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Automated deployment to staging
- Release automation
```

### 4. Monitoring & Maintenance
```markdown
Create: docs/MONITORING.md

- Performance metrics
- Alert configurations
- Health check endpoints
```

## üìä SDLC Maturity Assessment

| Phase | Maturity Level | Score | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Planning | Advanced | 8/10 | Clear vision, could use formal requirements |
| Design | Expert | 9/10 | Excellent architecture and design docs |
| Implementation | Advanced | 8/10 | Clean code, good practices |
| Testing | Intermediate | 6/10 | Framework ready, needs more automation |
| Deployment | Advanced | 8/10 | Docker setup excellent |
| Maintenance | Advanced | 8/10 | Great documentation and processes |

**Overall SDLC Maturity: Advanced (7.8/10)**

## üéØ Action Items for Full SDLC Compliance

### High Priority
1. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Implement automated test execution
   - Add code coverage reporting

2. **Formal Requirements Documentation**
